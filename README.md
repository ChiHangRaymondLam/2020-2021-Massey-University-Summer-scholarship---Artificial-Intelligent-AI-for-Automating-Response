# 2020-2021 Massey University Summer Scholarship---Artificial Intelligent (AI) for Automating Response

Project description

The Cybersecurity Lab in the discipline of Comp Sci/Info Tech is offering a number of summer scholarships for an area of studies for Artificial Intelligence (AI) to automate cybersecurity threat responses. Numerous possible topics might be explored within the following themes where the summer scholars will work with the existing team members that comprise of a project leader, PhD students and a postdoc.

A real-time situation awareness monitoring system that monitors and collects both common and Al- powered threats, with a high level of situation awareness analysis capability to provide a real-time ‘lens’ into Al capabilities of adversaries as well as vulnerability and readiness of important assets against threats;
The next generation cyber security orchestration powered by Al and game theory that can find the right set of response strategies or action sequences by examining the trade-off between the defence and attack strategies with a high visualisation capability to keep humans in the loop;
An autonomous threat response system that is resilient against emerging threats with self- protection, self-healing, and self-improvement capabilities via deep reinforcement learning and adaption that require minimum human intervention.
